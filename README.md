## PapalEncyclicals
#### Text Analysis of Papal Encyclicals from the past 150 using NLP.

This analysis will use NLP and clustering analyses to test a hypothesis: There has been a substantial change in the Catholic Church's Magisterial teaching since the 1960s.  

Debate has been lively around the topic of changing theology/teaching in the Catholic Church and the focus of that change has been around the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965).  The two positions that have been principally staked out on this issue are known as "Hermeneutic of Continuity" and "Hermeneutic of Rupture."  That is, we should interpret the Second Vatican Council as an event that continued the same unchanged teaching and theology (Hermeneutic of Continuity) or we should interpret it as a departure from what the church believed and taught previously (Hermeneutic of Rupture).  

This repo will participate in this debate by evaluating a key documentation from Magisterial authority, namely Papal Encyclicals.  Using NLP, I will analyze the language used in encyclicals prior to the 1960s and compare to those after the 1960s.  The objective being to determine if there was a radical shift in teaching as observed through Papal Encyclicals.

It is my desire that this repo will contibute to the debate in a healthy and constructive manner by presenting an objective view into the effects the Second Vatican Council has or has not had on Papal teaching.  But it should be well noted that NLP does not completely supplant a through reading of these documents and human analysis of the content therein.  Rather, I want to add this analysis as a quantitative measure of the content for consideration in the debate.
